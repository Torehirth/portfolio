A responsive, accessible portfolio showcasing my front-end development projects and experience.

## Description

This portfolio website highlights my journey as a front-end developer, showcasing key projects, skills, and experience. The site features light and dark mode options, follows WCAG guidelines, and is responsive across all devices. It includes sections such as:

- Landing Area with a large image, intro, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and other profiles.
- Projects Section showcasing three key projects:
    - Out 'n About – A blog website.
    - Rainy Days – An online store for jackets.
    - Community Science Museum – A museum website for kids and families.
- Skills Section detailing my front-end development skills.
- Experience Section formatted as a CV with card-style layouts.

The site is deployed using GitHub Actions, which handles both deployment via GitHub Pages and automatic version creation for each pull request and push to the main branch.
